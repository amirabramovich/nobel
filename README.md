The Nobel Prize is a set of annual international awards bestowed in several categories by Swedish and Norwegian institutions in recognition of academic, cultural, or scientific advances. 
Between 1901 and 2018, the Nobel Prizes (and the Prizes in Economic Sciences, from 1969 on) were awarded to 908 people. 
As of 2018, the Nobel Prize has been awarded to women 52 times. Only one woman, Marie Curie, has been honoured twice. 
This means that 51 women in total have been awarded the Nobel Prize between 1901 and 2018.

About Us
The creators are Amir Abramovich and Dean Caspy.
We are Computer Science students in Ben Gurion University.
We did this project as part of Digital Humanities course by guidance of Dr. Yael Netzer.

About the Project
We used nobelprize.org linked data tool through which we downloaded all the relevant data about nobel prize laureates and analyze it using open-refine tool and more databases like dbpedia and wikidata to acknowledge more information about the laureates, like religion, occurance etc.
We used python scripts and regular expressions in sublime and excel functions for ordering the data.
We used datawrapper.de app in order to analyze the data and create informative interactive charts.
